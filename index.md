# Bio

I am a third year Ph.D. student at [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/), advised by [Dr. Ken Choi](http://www.ece.iit.edu/~vlsida/people.html). My current research topic is HW/SW Co-Design for Low-Power Deep Neural Networks (DNN) deployment on embedded devices. I study state-of-the-art DNN, aiming to perform a full stack optimization on them from the Model-Level to the RT-Level, with a main focus on researching methods to co-design and co-optimize the hardware on which DNN run, with a special focus in re-configurable computing using devices like FPGAs.
